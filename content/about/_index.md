I am a physicist at the Flatiron Institute/Center for Computational Astrophysics. I am interested in transport processes, how matter and energy and other conserved quantities move in physical systems.

I spend most of my attention on transport in stars and planets, but am also interested in transport in condensed matter systems (electron hydrodynamics, phonon transport, etc.).

I hold a BS in Physics from Caltech (2015) and a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Cambridge (2018). I was previously a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB (2018-19).

In my spare time I like to write science fiction short stories. You can find some of my stories on [Github](https://adamjermyn.github.io/github.com/adamjermyn/ScifiShorts) and in the Cambridge University Science Fiction Society magazine ([1](http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/archives/ttba/ttba-2018-l.pdf),[2](http://cusfs.soc.srcf.net/archives/ttba/ttba-2017-s.pdf)).

If you think we could make something together, have questions about things I've done, or have feedback on things I could do better, please contact me at *adamjermyn[at]gmail.com*.
