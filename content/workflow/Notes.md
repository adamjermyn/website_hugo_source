## Notes

I take notes to support **reference**, **recollection**, and **accumulation**. This approach was heavily influenced by Andy Matuschak's concept of [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

### Reference

The best reference for learning something is usually not the most useful for applying it. I learned about random walks from the Feynman Lectures, but when I need to calculate diffusion coefficients I reference a note that just gives the answer and a few supporting details.

Reference notes should be optimized for frequently, repeated use. They should be short, focused, and linked. A note on diffusion should not explain random walks, it should **link** to another note which does.

Reference notes need to be totally reliable. If I have to double check the contents of a reference note it's a bad note.

### Recollection

I often want to remember what I heard in a talk or at a meeting. During talks and after meetings I record ideas that came up, things I need to do, and any references I was interested in.

Unlike reference notes, recollection notes do not need to be perfect. I do not expect to reference them over and over again, 

### Accumulation

Work should accumulate over time. I write notes to capture my thinking on projects over time. These notes can hold anything from definite facts to wild speculation: the purpose is to accumulate insights.

Accumulation notes are revisable and live in version control. They are similar in many ways to Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

I also write accumulation notes to capture brainstorming. I spend ten minutes per workday thinking of new ideas and writing down (almost) everything that comes to mind. Ideas go in Markdown files, one per day. I then [prioritize]({{< ref "/workflow/Prioritization" >}}) these once a week, and use that prioritization to steer how I spend my time.
